# Personal blog challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a two page blog site where people can write and see (unfortunately only their own) blogs. This consists of creating a main landing page for users to write their blog and submit to the blog page and also change their display. On the second page it required me to create a place for the users blogs to be posted and stored for future visits. I accomplished this with my html, css and js skills that I have learned so far and I learned more about how js can interact with html and css during this project. 

## Installation

You can either just go to the website from the Github repository or via this [link](https://ben-jamin05.github.io/personal-blog-challenge/) or clone the code from the repository. 

## Usage

Once you have navigated to the website it should look something like [This](./assets/images/mainpage.png). You will see a button in the top right that if you click it will change the display to dark mode and if you are already in dark mode to light mode. You will also see three text entry boxes. You must enter a username, title and content for your blog in order to post it. Once ready you can click submit and it will bring you to the blog page. That will look something like [This](./assets/images/blogpage.png). I wrote some example blogs that you can see but yours will appear there. On this page you can also adjust your display mode like on the last page. There is also another button located next to the display mode button that is the back button. This button will bring you back to the main page where you can write another blog. Also at the bottom of the page you can click on my name to take you to my portfolio or my email to send me an email. To clear your blogs clear your local storage in the dev tools.
